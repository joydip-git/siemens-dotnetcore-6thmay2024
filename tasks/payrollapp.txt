Payroll Application

Problem Statement: 
The application will be used to calculate and display salary of different types of employees, such as Developer, Manager, Human Resource people etc.

Classes:
Developer: 
data members: name, id, basicpayment, dapayment, hrapayment, incentivepayment, totalsalary [to store calculated total salary]

method:
name: CalculateSalary
arguments: None
return type: void

Hr: 
data members: name, id, basicpayment, dapayment, hrapayment, gratuitypayment, totalsalary [to store calculated total salary]
method:
name: CalculateSalary
arguments: None
return type: void


In “Main” method:
a.	Create an array to store at least two Developer and two Hr class object references.
b.	Ask for all the necessary inputs from user regarding Developer or Hr and then create the objects
c. Iterate through the array and display salary of the employees

Note:
I.		Every class should have both default and parameterized constructor
II.		Assigning values to the fields of the classes should be done through overloaded constructors
III.	Create properties for every data member of every class
IV. 	Child class constructor should call overloaded constructor of the base class explicitly to by-pass all the values to the base class, and get all the common fields assigned there in the base class itself
V. create a library for all the classes: Developer and HR
VI. create a console application and add reference to the library for using those classes from Main method
